
// Q2. Count the Heads

// Tina is given a string S which contains the first letter of all the student names in her class. She got a curiosity to check how
// many people have their names starting from the same alphabet. So given a string S, she decided to write a code that finds
// out the count of characters that occur more than once in the string.
// Note: You have to complete Count Head function. No need to take any input.
// Input Format
// The first and the only line of the input contains a string S (with no space and contains only lowercase letters).
// Output Format
// Return updated String S as output, where the string contains the charcter followed by their occurrence (if greater than 1) in
// alphabetical order.
// Constraints
// 1≤|S|≤100, where |S| denotes the length of string S. S contains only lowercase alphabets.
// Example
// Sample Input
// prepbytes
// Sample Output
// e2p2
